Score: 8.5/10

Comments: Firstly, you replaced the word Classes with Objects. Both are totally different.
Also, I could not understand question 4 & 5. The indentation of the document is totally off. You could have added more Classes, data & behavior in both the questions.
Example: Parking lot system can have Admin class. As most of the systems will usually with Admin Logins.
  Class : Administrator  
  Data : userName,password  
  Behaviour : login(userName,password), addParking(), changePrice(String vehicleType,float price) or so on..

In addition to this, please keep a single branch, I can see 2 branches main & master.
