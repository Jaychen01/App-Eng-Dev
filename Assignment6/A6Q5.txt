How would you differentiate between throw, 
throws and throwable in Java?
"throw" is used to throw an exception in a method, 
it is followed by a sub type of throwable;
"throws" is used to declare the method may throw exceptions, 
it is one way to handle an exception and followes the method name;
"throwable" is a super class for all types of errors and exceptions in java, 
Customized exceptions must extend this class.
