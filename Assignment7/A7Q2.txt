Write two differences between ArrayList and LinkedList.
ArrayList uses a dynamic array to store data, while 
LinkedList uses a doubly linked list to store data;
ArrayList is better to store and access data, while
LinkedList is better to manipulate the stored data
when remove an elment in the middle, ArrayList need 
more time to traverse and the memorty bits will be shifted, 
while LinkedList just need to change the reference link which takes less time.
